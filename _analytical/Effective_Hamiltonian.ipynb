    "# Flip-Flop Qubit Coupling Mediated By Microwave Cavity\n",
    "In this research work, we seek to compute the effective coupling between flip-flop qubits via a long microwave cavity. This is motivated by the fact that we want to build large scale quantum computing architectures but are currently restricted by the range at which we can couple spin qubits. Currently, spin coupling is done via the exchange coupling, which requires wavefunction overlap. What we want is to couple spins at distances much larger than that, in the order of hundred of nanometers, which is possible via mocrowave cavity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do so, we couple the spins to the donor charge qubit. The charge qubits form electric dipoles which can couple to photons in the cavity."
